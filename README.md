# Legend of Skunk

## Overview

This is a project that was inspired by [Ryan64](https://www.youtube.com/@Ryan64yt)'s "[The WORST PARTS in Every ZELDA Game](https://youtu.be/EsNPLcHm54Q?si=0gQMCOnU9up1q6zv)". I've always wanted to try my hands at game development and I thought that it would be really fun to make a game that incorporate these mechanics together and see how it turns out. The title is also just a placeholder, but I thought it was funny since skunks are known for being stinky and I am planning on making a game with supposedly "stinky" mechanics.

## Mechanics Wishlist

* 2D/2.5D for the main overworld with combat similar to "A Link to the Past"
* Side scroller platformers sections (similar to Link's Awakening), with combat similar to Zelda 2
* Swimming should be slow and tedius, but have a fast and fun mode that uses Mana
* The game menu should be reminicent of Ocarina of Time with 4 distinct sections to scroll through
* Equipable items for certain skills/puzzles
* Game story should mostly be delivered via "dragon tears", similar to tears of the kingdom, with no obvious guidance on which is first
* Certain game progression areas/dungeons should be hidden/hard to find similar to Zelda 1
  - An idea for this would be to have masks like in majora's mask that require the player to go into the menu to use on a particular spot to reveal a new area/entrance
* Bosses should be either similar to the ones from A Link to the Past or Zelda 2, but have some unifying trait/weakpoints that gets revealed perioditicly during the fight, similar to the eyes on the back of enemies on the 3DS Majora's Mask
* Include some requirement before the final boss to collect an item (similar to the 8 triforce pieces on Wind Waker)
* The end of the game should in some way undo part of the story (either like the wind fish waking up, or Zelda being able to become human again on Tears of the Kingdom)
* Beating the final boss should have some prior requirement when getting into boss room (enough mana or an specific item), otherwise the fight is impossible
  - After beating the final boss we either have a phase 2 or a new boss, similar to dark link on Zelda 2
* Perhaps consider introducing either a New Game+ or easier game mode with some quality of life improvements to make the game more fun (TBD)
* Must include at least one escort quest dungeon and one slow moving NPC (for fun :D)
* An intro similar to Twilight Princess (might conflict with the idea of not giving the player direction)

### Optional Mechanics

* Flute from Spirit tracks?
* Stamina Meter? (BotW) - Could replace mana for fast swimming
* Baseball Minigame? (Link Between worlds)
* Weapon Durability? (BotW)
